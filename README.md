This program simulates a real ATM machine. The user will enter their username (substituting for a card) and their pin.
Once logged in, using their data from MS SQL, a second window will appear with their total amount of money displayed in a textbox.
From there, the user can enter into a second textbox on the same form a number they wish to deposit or withdraw into their account.
Their total amount of money will be affected in real time and the SQL database will be updated as well.
